# Express-react-barebone

_WORK IN PROGRESS
USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS._

A barebone framework supporting basic backend routing and frontend routing using React-Router and basic React components to get you started quickly.

## 1- Requirements
* Node.js
* NPM (Comes bundled with node.js nowadays)
* a unix-like shell environment (for ease of use)

## Setup

1- Clone this repository into the folder of your choice.

2- `sudo npm install -g webpack`. A global install of webpack will help shorten commands for your dev environnement. You can still use the one packaged in the `node_modules`.

3- `npm start`. This will start the node server and run webpack once. You may want to start this in a separate shell window.

4- There you go! `localhost:3000` should get work (rendering nothing though).

## Dev

Have a shell window running `webpack -w`. It will rebuild the front-end portion as you work on your React files.
